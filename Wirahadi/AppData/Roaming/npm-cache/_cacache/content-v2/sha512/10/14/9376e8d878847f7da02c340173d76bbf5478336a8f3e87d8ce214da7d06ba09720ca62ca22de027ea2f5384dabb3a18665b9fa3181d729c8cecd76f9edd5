sharp\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lovell/sharp@master/docs/image/sharp-logo.svg\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" alt=\"sharp logo\" align=\"right\">\n\nThe typical use case for this high speed Node.js module\nis to convert large images in common formats to\nsmaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG, WebP and AVIF images of varying dimensions.\n\nResizing an image is typically 4x-5x faster than using the\nquickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings\ndue to its use of [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips).\n\nColour spaces, embedded ICC profiles and alpha transparency channels are all handled correctly.\nLanczos resampling ensures quality is not sacrificed for speed.\n\nAs well as image resizing, operations such as\nrotation, extraction, compositing and gamma correction are available.\n\nMost modern macOS, Windows and Linux systems running Node.js v10+\ndo not require any additional install or runtime dependencies.\n\n## Documentation\n\nVisit [sharp.pixelplumbing.com](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) for complete\n[installation instructions](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install),\n[API

Examples\n\n```sh\nnpm install sharp\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst sharp = require('sharp');\n```\n\n### Callback\n\n```javascript\nsharp(inputBuffer)\n  .resize(320, 240)\n  .toFile('output.webp', (err, info) => { ... });\n```\n\n### Promise\n\n```javascript\nsharp('input.jpg')\n  .rotate()\n  .resize(200)\n  .jpeg({ mozjpeg: true })\n  .toBuffer()\n  .then( data => { ... })\n  .catch( err => { ... });\n```\n\n### Async/await\n\n```javascript\nconst semiTransparentRedPng = await sharp({\n  create: {\n    width: 48,\n    height: 48,\n    channels: 4,\n    background: { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, alpha: 0.5 }\n  }\n})\n  .png()\n  .toBuffer();\n```\n\n### Stream\n\n```javascript\nconst roundedCorners = Buffer.from(\n  '<svg><rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" rx=\"50\" ry=\"50\"/></svg>'\n);\n\nconst roundedCornerResizer =\n  sharp()\n    .resize(200, 200)\n    .composite([{\n      input: roundedCorners,\n      blend: 'dest-in'\n    }])\n    .png();\n\nreadableStream\n  .pipe(roundedCornerResizer)\n  .pipe(writableStream);\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nA [guide for
